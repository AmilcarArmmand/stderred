Description: stderr in red
 stderred hooks on write() and a family of stream functions (fwrite, fprintf,
 error...) from libc in order to colorize all stderr output that goes to
 terminal thus making it distinguishable from stdout. Basically it wraps text
 that goes to file with descriptor "2" with proper ANSI escape codes making text
 red. It's implemented as a shared library and doesn't require recompilation of
 existing binaries thanks to preload/insert feature of dynamic linkers.
